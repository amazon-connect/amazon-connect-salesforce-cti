## Contributing

Important rules to keep in mind while contributing to preserve compatibility with our [pdf generator](util/generatePDF.js) and [toc generator](util/generateTOC.js):

- All folders (to be included in the generated pdf) must lead with numbers-- ex. 01 [title]
- The pdf generator, when crawling through a folder, will parse first through the readme file,
  then through the markdown files in the folder ordered lexicographically, then through the subfolders
  ordered lexicographically
- When linking internally, make sure that the header of the section the link points to has an
  id that matches the text of the link, lowercase, and with dashes (-) in place for spaces.
  ex. \[Key Benefits and Requirements\]\(...\) will navigate to a link with id 'key-benefits-and-requirements'
- To make sure a header is added to the table of contents, add the class "toc" to the header.
  ex \<h1 class="toc"\> Key Benefits and Requirements \<\/h1\>
- Entries in the table of contents are indented based on header level (h1 - 0 indent, h2 - 1 indent, etc)
