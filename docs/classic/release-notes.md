Important: when upgrading the CTI Adapter, please make sure that the Salesforce Lambdas are also updated to the newest version.

## 5.15 July 2021

When installing v5.15, please **confirm that the application was installed for admins only** (see [installation](/docs/classic/installation/01-installation) for more details). If you did this by accident, then you will have to [manually edit the profiles](/docs/classic/installation/06-cti-adapter-installation-troubleshooting#how-to-remove-permissions-to-visualforce-pages-apex-classes-for-a-desired-profile) to remove the permissions to the objects and pages created by the app.

- **Feature: Guided Setup** The Guided Setup feature helps make the setup process easier. See [Guided Setup](/docs/classic/installation/02-guided-setup) for more details.
- **Feature: Chat Widget Integration for SalesForce Experience Cloud(formerly Community Cloud)** Added VisualForce Page component that allows you to add Amazon Connect Chat Widget in your Salesforce Experience Cloud Site.
- **Enhancement:** Changed the default audio recording component in the Contact Channel Analytics for easier setup. See [Call Recording Playback](/docs/classic/cti-adapter/04-call-recording-playback) for more details. 
- **Enhancement:** Created the ExecuteAwsService service for simpler communication between Salesforce and AWS. **WARNING:** If you are using Contact Lens for audio recording you *must* replace your existing AwsGenerateAudioRecordingUrl named credential with with the ExecuteAwsService named credential. See [here](/docs/classic/installation/01-installation#setting-up-the-executeawsservice-named-credential) for more details.
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed an issue with the lambda package that caused Contact Lens Call Recording Streaming to be broken for redacted calls.
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed an issue that caused the "Clear All Properties" CTI Flow Block to clear properties important to the CTI adpater working.
- **Bug Fix:** Added the `DISCONNECT` field to the `Initiation Method` field in Contact Trace Records.

## 5.14 June 2021

- **Bugfix:** The issue that caused an Attribute label to not display properly in the attributes panel has been fixed.
- **Bugfix:** The issue that caused AC Queue Metrics tab's name showing blank has been fixed.
- **Bugfix:** The issue that caused the Recording Panel button to fail when a url is used for connect instance alias has been fixed.
- **Enhancement:** We now make it possible for voicemail drops to work with queue callbacks.
- **Enhancement:** You can now configure the CT Action Recording Panel's initial state using contact attributes. If you're recording your call, make sure to add an attribute named `RECORDING_STARTED` whose value is `true` in your Contact Flow.
- **Enhancement:** We have added `IfCurrentAgentState` tag to `SetAgentStatusOnSessionEnd` feature, which allows customers to condition this feature on the Agent's current state.

## 5.13 April 2021

- **Feature: CTI Actions - programmable buttons within the CCP overlay**

In this release, we have added a feature called CTI Action which are programmable buttons for your CTI Flows. Each CTI Action is a button that can be programmed to trigger a CTI Flows whose source value is "CTI Action." In addition, CTI Actions can be programmed to ask the agent for additional information via a data entry form. You can use the agent's entry in your CTI Flow with the help of "Get Payload" block. This is a great way to ask your agents to enter ad-hoc data prior to running the CTI Flow to provide additional information as part of a workflow to automate case creation, or start a customer refund process. **If you are upgrading from a previous version of the CTI Adapter, please be sure to review the [additional setup steps required](/docs/classic/cti-adapter/10-cti-actions#upgrading-from-an-earlier-version) for CTI Actions.**

- **Feature: CTI Actions: recording API integration within the CCP overlay**

The CTI Adapter now includes integration with Connect's recording API. This feature allows the agent to control when to start and stop recording a call. Once the recording has started, they can also pause and resume it. For example, agents can pause a recording before asking for sensitive information from your customers. Once the agent stops a recording, you cannot start it again. Use pause/resume buttons after you've started recording a call to control the recording.

- **Enhancement: Voicemail Drops (beta)**

The **[beta Voicemail Drops](/docs/lightning/cti-adapter/10-voicemail-drops)** feature now integrates with CTI Actions. In the beta, voicemail drops were loaded directly into the CCP Overlay. As of 5.13, you will need to create a CTI Action, and use the newly added "Leave a Voicemail" block in the CTI Flow where you can configure the specific voicemail drop and the quick connect name to use for the voicemail.

- **Feature: CCP Overlay: Data panel to receive data from CTI Flows.**

You can now send data from a CTI Flow to the CCP Overlay. The Data panel on CCP Overlay will display any object you pass it from "Send Data to CCP Overlay" block.

- **Feature: CTI Flow Blocks: "Start Recording" and "Stop Recording"**

With "Start Recording" and "Stop Recording" blocks, you can control the voice recording of the call within your CTI Flows.

- **Feature: CTI Flow Block: "Update Contact Attributes"**

You can now update contract attributes using CTI Flows. This block accepts a list of key-value pairs and assigns them to the currently active contact. It may come handy for passing Case id and other important information to the next agent when transferring a call.

- **Feature: CTI Flow Block: "Get Payload"**

The `payload` object contains the arguments passed to the CTI Flow. Now you will be able to use "Get Payload" block to reference a payload key as an input in other blocks on your CTI Flow.

- **Feature: CTI Flow Block: "Send Data to CCP Overlay"**

This block allows you to send data to your agent from a CTI flow. The agent will see this information in the CCP Overlay in a panel entitled "Data."

- **Feature: CTI Flow Block: "Leave a Voicemail"**

This block works with the beta Voicemail Drops feature. When you configure the voicemailDropName and quickConnectName, it will pass the contact to an IVR to leave a voicemail on the agent's behalf.

- **Feature: CTI Flow Block: "Get Salesforce Lead ID":** This block allows you to get a Salesforce lead by using a phone number.

- **Enhancement:** "Get Salesforce Contact Id" block now uses FIND syntax to search across multiple fields.

- **BugFix:** For the `SetAgentStatusOnSessionEnd` feature, it would occasionally fail if the agent hadn't interacted with the webpage. We solve this by creating a popout to monitor the agent session.

- **Enhancement:** For the `SetAgentStatusOnSessionEnd` attribute, you can now specify multiple values.

- **Enhancement:** When `SetAgentStatusOnSessionEnd` feature is enabled, you can now configure which state the agent should be shown as when they login with the InitialAgentState setting.

- **Enhancement:** When `SetAgentStatusOnSessionEnd` feature is enabled, you can now configure which agent to logout when all tabs are closed by setting the Status to Logout.

- **Bugfix:** Addressed issue that caused CTI Flows to be run on every open Salesforce tab.

- **Bugfix:** Addressed an issue in "Get Salesforce Contact Id" block that caused the query to fail if the phone number was in E164 format.

- **Enhancement**: Added the onDestroy Event to certain CTI Flow Sources
