### Amazon Connect Salesforce CTI Adapter Managed Package

The Amazon Connect CTI Adapter for Salesforce provides the core
integration between the two platforms. It embeds the Amazon Connect
Contact Control Panel into Salesforce which provides telephony control
as well as access to event data coming from Amazon Connect. Using this
adapter, you can configure screen pops based on customer data, automate
contact center telephony functions like click-to-dial, and establish
presence syncing rules for integration with Salesforce Omni-Channel.
This is the base of the integration.

The first step in the deployment of the integration is to install the
Amazon Connect CTI Adapter managed package from the AppExchange
Marketplace.

1.  Log in into your Salesforce org and go to **Setup**

2.  In the **Quick Find**, type **AppExchange** (the results will
    populate without hitting enter)

3.  Select **AppExchange Marketplace** from the links provided

4.  In the AppExchange window, enter **Amazon Connect** into the
    **Search AppExchange** field and press enter

5.  In the **Search Results**, select **Amazon Connect CTI Adapter**

6.  On the **Amazon Connect CTI Adapter** detail page, select **Get It
    Now**

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image4.png')} />

7.  If you are presented with the Log In to AppExchange screen, select
    **Open Login Screen**. You should then be presented with an Allow
    Access Screen. Choose **Allow**

8.  On the **Where do you want to installÂ Amazon Connect CTI Adapter**
    page, choose the **Install Here** button in the Install in This Org
    section

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image6.png')} />

9.  On the **Confirm installation details** screen, fill out the **Tell
    us about yourself** form, check the box to **agree with the terms
    and conditions**, and optionally select the box to **allow the
    provider to contact you**. Then select **Confirm and Install**

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image7.png')} />

10. Select **Install for Admins Only**, then choose **Install**. **THIS SELECTION IS VERY IMPORTANT** - if you select the wrong option, then standard users may have access to objects and pages that they shouldn't have access to.

11. The CTI Adapter will take some time to install. While it installs,
    you will be presented with the **This app is taking a long time to
    install screen.**

12. Choose **Done**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image9.png')} />

13. Once you receive confirmation that the **installation has
    completed** via email, return to the browser

14. Close the **Amazon Connect CTI Adapter** detail page (if still open)

15. In Quick Find, enter **Installed**, then select Installed Packages
    from the result

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image10.png')} />

16. Once the **Installed Packages** page opens, validate that the
    **Amazon Connect -- Universal Package** is installed

### Amazon Connect Salesforce Lambda package

The Amazon Connect Salesforce Lambda package adds considerable
capability to the integration. It includes data connectivity between
Amazon Connect and Salesforce for typical tasks like lookups, case
creation, and updates. Additionally, it adds new features like real-time
and historical data imports, contact trace record imports, recording
import, transcription, and contact analytics functions. These
capabilities are configurable and can be activated or deactivated on a
call-by-call basis.

The Amazon Connect Salesforce Lambda package is delivered via the AWS
Serverless Application Repository. The AWS Serverless Application
Repository enables you to quickly deploy code samples, components, and
complete applications. Each application is packaged with an AWS
Serverless Application Model (SAM) template that defines the AWS
resources used. There is no additional charge to use the Serverless
Application Repository - you only pay for the AWS resources used in the
applications you deploy.

1.  In a new browser tab, login to the [AWS
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)

2.  Make sure you are in the same region as your Amazon Connect instance

3.  Once you have selected the region, navigate to the [Amazon Connect
    Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/home)

4.  Verify that the Amazon Connect instance that you wish to configure
    is listed

5.  Once you have verified your Amazon Connect instance, Open the
    [Serverless Application Repository
    Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/serverlessrepo/home)

6.  In the left navigation, select **Available Applications**

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image78.png')} />

7.  In the search area, make sure that **Public applications** is
    selected, check the box for **Show apps that create custom IAM roles
    or resource policies**, and enter **Salesforce** in the search
    field, this will automatically filter the available packages

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image79.png')} />

8.  Select AmazonConnectSalesForceLambda

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image80.png')} />

9.  When the Application loads, scroll down to the **Application
    settings** section

10. If you would like to use the Guided Setup feature, **don't change any parameters in the template** and select **Deploy**, 
    and wait for the stack to finish deployment. Then, follow the section below on setting up the ExecuteAwsService named credential.
    If you are not using the Guided Setup feature, navigate to [here](/docs/classic/installation/03-managed-package-manual-setup) and follow the instructions (skipping the rest of the instructions on the page).

### Setting up the ExecuteAwsService Named Credential

The ExecuteAwsService Named Credential is the entrypoint for the CTI Adapter to communicate with your AWS account.
The Apex code uses the Named Credential to call the `sfExecuteAwsService.py` lambda, which uses boto3 to make changes
in and retrieve data from your AWS account. Setting up this Named Credential is **not required** if you do not wish
to use the features that rely on it (Guided Setup and Contact Lens). In addition, you can alter the permissions given
to the `sfExecuteAwsService` lambda to match your security requirements (NOTE: if you choose to do so, do so after you
configure up the lambdas as some permissions are added/removed based on how the lambdas are configured).

Before you create the ExecuteAwsService Named Credential, **confirm that the application was installed for admins only**. If not, then standard users may be able to invoke methods that call named credentials. If you did this by accident, then you will have to [manually edit the profiles](/docs/classic/installation/06-cti-adapter-installation-troubleshooting#how-to-remove-permissions-to-visualforce-pages-apex-classes-for-a-desired-profile) to remove the permissions to the objects and pages created by the app.

3. Select **Attach existing policies directly**, then search for and select *invokeSfExecuteAWSServicePolicy*.

7. Navigate to your setup section of your Salesforce instance, and search for *Named Credentials*.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/shared/installation4.png')} />

8. Select **New Named Credential**. For the values in the next screen, enter the following:

- **Label**: ExecuteAwsService
- **URL**: ```https://lambda.{insert AWS region}.amazonaws.com/2015-03-31/functions/{insert lambda function name (copied above)}/invocations```
- **Identity Type**: Named Principle
- **Authentication Protocol**: AWS Signature Version 4
- **AWS Access Key ID**: **Access Key ID** copied above
- **AWS Secret Access Key**: **Secret Access Key**
- **AWS Region**: {insert AWS region}
- **AWS Service**: lambda
