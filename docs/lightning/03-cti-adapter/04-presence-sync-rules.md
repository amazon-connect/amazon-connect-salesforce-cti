The CTI Adapter supports bidirectional synchronization of agent state
between Amazon Connect and Salesforce Omnichannel. This allows you to
tightly control agent availability for different contact/media types
dependent on current agent state. This section of the guide assumes that
you have Omnichannel configured appropriately. If you do not and wish to
test this function, please refer to the section [Configure Salesforce Omnichannel for Testing](/docs/lightning/appendices/appendix-a-required-salesforce-configurations/02-configure-salesforce-omnichannel).

NOTE: In order for Presence Sync to work, the CTI Adapter must be
configured to allow it. See [CTI Adapter Details](/docs/lightning/cti-adapter/01-cti-adapter-configuration)
for more information.

Presence Sync Rules are evaluated based on specific events. The
available events are:

-   **Connect Agent State Change:** The Connect agent's state has
    changed.

-   **Salesforce Agent State Change:** The Salesforce agent's state has
    changed.

-   **Salesforce Agent Logout:** The Salesforce agent has logged out.

-   **Salesforce Work Accepted:** The Salesforce agent has accepted
    work.

-   **Salesforce Workload Changed:** The Salesforce agent's workload has
    changed.

Once the event is triggered, the CTI adapter will evaluate the provided
criteria. The criteria is established by comparing Operand A, using
standard comparator options, against Operand B. Possible options for
Operand A and B are:

-   **Connect Agent New State:** The Connect agent's new state value

-   **Connect Agent Old State:** The Connect agent's old (previous)
    state value

-   **Salesforce Agent New State:** The Salesforce agent's new state
    value

-   **Salesforce Service Channel:** The service channel upon which the
    Salesforce agent has accepted work

-   **Salesforce Previous Workload:** The Salesforce agent's previous
    workload

-   **Salesforce Previous Workload Pct:** The Salesforce agent's
    pervious workload expressed as a percent of configured capacity

-   **Salesforce New Workload:** The Salesforce agent's new workload

-   **Salesforce New Workload Pct:** The Salesforce agent's new workload
    expressed as a percent of configured capacity

-   **Salesforce Configured Capacity:** The Salesforce agent's
    configured capacity

-   **Static Value:** The user may provide a value. For example, a
    custom agent state name or other alphanumeric value. When Static
    Value is selected a "Value" field becomes visible to accept the
    users static value input.

Available comparators are:

-   **Equal to:** Are Operand A and Operand B equal

-   **Not equal to:** Are Operand A and Operand B not equal

-   **Greater than:** Is Operand A greater than Operand B

-   **Greater than or equal to:** Is Operand A greater than or equal to
    Operand B

-   **Less than:** Is Operand A less than Operand B

-   **Less than or equal to:** Is Operand A less than or equal to
    Operand B

### Configuring Statuses

Presence Sync Rules require statuses in both Amazon Connect and
Salesforce. In this example, we will add two additional statuses to each
side of the configuration and prepare rules that sync both clients to
the same state regardless of which agent sets the status. Essentially,
you will configure the status sync similar to the following example:

| When a sets status to b                        | Set x to y                        |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Amazon Connect sets status to Available        | Omnichannel to Available          |
| Omnichannel sets status to Available           | Amazon Connect to Available       |
| Amazon Connect sets status to Working -- Phone | Omnichannel to Working -- Phone   |
| Omnichannel sets status to Working -- Media    | Amazon Connect to Working - Media |

### Amazon Connect System Statuses

The following Amazon Connect CCP statuses are system statuses that can be used in presence sync.
Please note however that these statuses are restricted and you cannot set the Amazon Connect status
to the below.
- Busy - agent is in a call
- Pending - agent is receiving a request for a queue callback
- PendingBusy - agent is receiving call
- CallingCustomer - agent is calling customer
- AfterCallWork - agent is in the after call work screen

### Create Presence Statuses in Amazon Connect

Agents are responsible for setting their status in the Contact Control
Panel (CCP). Typically, the only time an agent\'s status changes is when
they manually change it in the CCP however Presence Sync Rules can
automate the process when conditions are met.

Amazon Connect provides two default status values:

-   Available

-   Offline

You can change the name of these values, and you can add new ones. For
example, you might add a status for Lunch, and another for Training.
These and the default status values will be used for reporting, metrics,
and resource management.

**Note:** When you add a new status, it will always be **Custom**, not
routable.

#### Create an Amazon Connect status

1.  Login to your Amazon Connect instance as an Administrator

2.  From the left navigation, choose **Users**, then select **Agent
    status**

    
<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image145.png')} />

3.  Select **Add new agent status**

4.  Provide a Status name and Description. Leave the Enabled checkbox
    selected.

    
<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image146.png')} />

5.  Select Save. Repeat as desired for the remaining statuses that you
    wish to add.

### Create Presence Statuses in Salesforce

You will need to configure presence statuses to reflect the different
presence states that you wish your Omni-Channel agents to enter. These
do not need to match agent statuses in Amazon Connect exactly, but it
does make it easier to track what you are doing.

#### Create a Salesforce presence status

1.  Log in into your Salesforce org and go to **Setup**

2.  In the **Quick Find** field, enter presence and choose **Presence
    Statuses** from the results
    
    
<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image147.png')} />

3.  In the Presence Statuses page, choose New

4.  Provide a status name, for example Lunch

5.  Set the Status options appropriately, for example, Busy

    a.  For Online statuses, you will need to provide a channel. Please
        reference the [Omni-Channel
        documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=omnichannel_intro.htm&type=5)
        for details

6.  Choose Save

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image148.png')} />

7.  Repeat as necessary for all desired statuses

#### Configure Enabled Service Presences Status Access in Salesforce

1.  Log in into your Salesforce org and go to **Setup**

2.  In the **Quick Find** field, enter profiles and choose **Profiles**
    from the results

    
<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image149.png')} />

3.  Select the profile assigned to your users

4.  Hover over the Enabled Service Presence Status link and choose Edit

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image150.png')} />

5.  Select the available status from the left, then choose the Add
    button to add it the Enabled Service Presence Statuses field
    
<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image151.png')} />

6.  Select Save

7.  Repeat as necessary for other statuses or profiles.

### Configure Presence Sync Rules

The CTI Adapter provides a rules-based presence status synchronization
system allowing for flexibility in mapping agent states between Amazon
Connect and Salesforce Omni-Channel.

Presence synchronization actions may be configured based upon manual
agent state changes (agent goes on break), system agent state changes
(answering a call), omnichannel agent work (agent accepts an email), and
omnichannel workload changes (agent completes an email) as examples.

As the scope of presence sync rules can vary wildly, this example will
show you how to change state based on Amazon Connect agent state change
and Salesforce agent state change.

#### Create a Presence Sync Rule

1.  Log in into your Salesforce org and go to the **Service Console**

2.  Expand the **navigation menu** by selecting the down arrow and
    choose **AC CTI Adapters**.
    
<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image114.png')} />

3.  Select **ACLightningAdapter**

4.  Scroll down to the **Presence Sync Rules** section

5.  Select **New** to create a new presence sync rule

6.  Provide a **Presence Sync Rule Name** to identify the use case of
    this rule. For example: Connect agent switches to Lunch
    
<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image152.png')} />

7.  Select **Next**

8.  For Source, select **Connect Agent State Change**, and select
    **Next**

9.  For Operand A, choose **Connect Agent New State**

10. Set the Comparator to **Equal to**

11. Set Operand B to **Static Value**

12. For Operand B Value, enter **Lunch** (Or whatever state you have
    created in Amazon Connect)**
    
<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image153.png')} />

13. Select **Next**

14. For Destination, choose **Salesforce Agent State**

15. Set the Value to **Lunch** (Or whatever state you have configured in
    Salesforce)
        **NOTE:** the static value for Salesforce Omni-Channel status is the
    Developer Name, not the Status Name

16. Select **Save.**

17. Refresh your browser

18. In the bottom left corner of the Service Console, select the CTI
    Softphone icon

    
<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image46.png')} />

19. Set your Amazon Connect agent status to Lunch

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image154.png')} />

20. Observe that the Omni-Channel status switches to Lunch

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/lightning/image155.png')} />

21. Repeat this process as desired to configure your presence sync
    rules.
