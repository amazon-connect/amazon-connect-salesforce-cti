### WebRTC Plan-B Deprecation
The Plan-B deprecation should not affect any current users of the CTI Adapter, as we utilize the embedded CCP and do not build in connect-rtc-js seperately. 

**Important:** when upgrading the CTI Adapter, please make sure that the Salesforce Lambdas are also updated to the newest version. Also review the [CTI Adapter Installation Troubleshooting and Common Issues](/docs/lightning/installation/06-adapter-installation-troubleshooting) section for known issues and troubleshooting.

## 5.17 November 2021

- **Feature:** Added the integration with Amazon Connect Wisdom, which delivers articles and article recommendations to agents. See [here](/docs/lightning/cti-adapter/12-wisdom-integration) for more details.
- **Feature:** Added the integration with Voice id, which provides real-time caller authentication. See [here](/docs/lightning/cti-adapter/13-voice-id) for more details.
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed a bug where CTI Actions would only load if you switched overlay tabs. Now they will load immediately.
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed a few bugs with Contact Attributes Overlay. 
  - Where you needed to set they would not populate in the overlay unless the CTI Attribute Name value was the same as the contact attribute key.
  - Selecting DisplayValue of `Key` did not show just the Key value.
  - When using the ShowAllAttributes feature, the already configured CTI Attributes did not maintain the same HTML formatting as before.
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed a bug where DialedNumber__c was not filled on outbound calls.
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed a bug where Update Contact Attributes didn't work for Chat or Task contacts.
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed a bug where the CTI Flow payload would only contain the CTI Action Additional Data when both CTI Action Payload and Additional Data are configured. Now the CTI Flow payload will have both the CTI Action Payload and Additional Data
- **Enhancement:** Added two new CTI Flow Blocks - Destroy Live Contact and Clear Contact. 


## 5.16 August 2021

- **Feature:** Added a `callIncomingDuration` field to the `Contact Interaction Metadata` CTI Flow block, which captures the time between the call coming into an agent and it being accepted/missed/declined.
- **Feature:** Moved the medialess popout page to be an optional feature. Learn how to enabled it [here](/docs/lightning/cti-adapter/01-cti-adapter-configuration#medialess-popout-ccp)
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed an issue where the `callInteractionDuration` would be too large if the call is missed. It is now defaulted to 0 if the call is not picked up.
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed an issue with the medialess adapter where media was still coming through the adapter and causing audio quality issues. Now, when the medialess option is checked, this will disable the allowFramedSoftphone option in CCP config, and media will not be sent through the CCP embedded on Salesforce.
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed an issue where Agents couldn't see some CTI Actions if more than 20 CTI Actions are set up. Now, a scroll bar should appear to navigate to all of them.
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed an issue with the isInbound CTI Flow block, which would return false if the Customer hangs up the error before the Agent could answer the call, even if it was inbound.
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed an issue with the InitialAgentStatus sub-feature of SetAgentStatusOnSessionEnd, which would not follow the IfProfileNameIncludes condition.
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed an issue with CCP overlay where if no additional data is added, including Title, Instructions and Fields, the right pointing caret icon will be displayed for detailed form view. Now the execute button will be displayed in this case.
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed an issue with CCP overlay where the order parameter was not affecting the sorting of the CTI Actions in the overlay.
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed an issue with the CCP Element Editor where typing the CTI Action name first caused the cursor to move out of the input box.
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed an issue with the Set Agent Salesforce State CTI Flow block.

## 5.15 July 2021

When installing v5.15, please **confirm that the application was installed for admins only** (see [installation](/docs/lightning/installation/01-installation) for more details). If you did this by accident, then you will have to [manually edit the profiles](/docs/lightning/installation/06-adapter-installation-troubleshooting#how-to-remove-permissions-to-visualforce-pages-apex-classes-for-a-desired-profile) to remove the permissions to the objects and pages created by the app.

- **Feature: Guided Setup** The Guided Setup feature helps make the setup process easier. See [Guided Setup](/docs/lightning/installation/02-guided-setup) for more details.
- **Feature: Chat Widget Integration for SalesForce Experience Cloud(formerly Community Cloud)** Added VisualForce Page component that allows you to add Amazon Connect Chat Widget in your Salesforce Experience Cloud Site.
- **Enhancement:** Changed the default audio recording component in the Contact Channel Analytics for easier setup. See [Contact Channel Analytics](/docs/lightning/salesforce-lambdas/04-contact-channel-analytics) for more details.
- **Enhancement:** Created the ExecuteAwsService service for simpler communication between Salesforce and AWS. **WARNING:** If you are using Contact Lens for audio recording you *must* replace your existing AwsGenerateAudioRecordingUrl named credential with with the ExecuteAwsService named credential. See [here](/docs/lightning/installation/01-installation#setting-up-the-executeawsservice-named-credential) for more details.
- **Bug Fix:** Fixed an issue with the lambda package that caused Contact Lens Call Recording Streaming to be broken for redacted calls.

- **Enhancement:** We now make it possible for voicemail drops to work with queue callbacks.
- **Enhancement:** You can now configure the CT Action Recording Panel's initial state using contact attributes. If you're recording your call, make sure to add an attribute named `RECORDING_STARTED` whose value is `true` in your Contact Flow.
- **Enhancement:** We have added `IfCurrentAgentState` tag to `SetAgentStatusOnSessionEnd` feature, which allows customers to condition this feature on the Agent's current state.

## 5.13 April 2021

- **Feature: CTI Actions - programmable buttons within the CCP overlay**

In this release, we have added a feature called CTI Action which are programmable buttons for your CTI Flows. Each CTI Action is a button that can be programmed to trigger a CTI Flows whose source value is "CTI Action." In addition, CTI Actions can be programmed to ask the agent for additional information via a data entry form. You can use the agent's entry in your CTI Flow with the help of "Get Payload" block. This is a great way to ask your agents to enter ad-hoc data prior to running the CTI Flow to provide additional information as part of a workflow to automate case creation, or start a customer refund process. **If you are upgrading from a previous version of the CTI Adapter, please be sure to review the [additional setup steps required](/docs/lightning/cti-adapter/08-cti-actions#upgrading-from-an-earlier-version) for CTI Actions.**

- **Feature: CTI Actions: recording API integration within the CCP overlay**

The CTI Adapter now includes integration with Connect's recording API. This feature allows the agent to control when to start and stop recording a call. Once the recording has started, they can also pause and resume it. For example, agents can pause a recording before asking for sensitive information from your customers. Once the agent stops a recording, you cannot start it again. Use pause/resume buttons after you've started recording a call to control the recording.

- **Enhancement: Voicemail Drops (beta)**

The **[beta Voicemail Drops](/docs/lightning/cti-adapter/10-voicemail-drops)** feature now integrates with CTI Actions. In the beta, voicemail drops were loaded directly into the CCP Overlay. As of 5.13, you will need to create a CTI Action, and use the newly added "Leave a Voicemail" block in the CTI Flow where you can configure the specific voicemail drop and the quick connect name to use for the voicemail.

- **Feature: CCP Overlay: Data panel to receive data from CTI Flows.**

You can now send data from a CTI Flow to the CCP Overlay. The Data panel on CCP Overlay will display any object you pass it from "Send Data to CCP Overlay" block.

- **Feature: CTI Flow Blocks: "Start Recording" and "Stop Recording"**

With "Start Recording" and "Stop Recording" blocks, you can control the voice recording of the call within your CTI Flows.

- **Feature: CTI Flow Block: "Update Contact Attributes"**

You can now update contract attributes using CTI Flows. This block accepts a list of key-value pairs and assigns them to the currently active contact. It may come handy for passing Case id and other important information to the next agent when transferring a call.

- **Feature: CTI Flow Block: "Get Payload"**

The `payload` object contains the arguments passed to the CTI Flow. Now you will be able to use "Get Payload" block to reference a payload key as an input in other blocks on your CTI Flow.

- **Feature: CTI Flow Block: "Send Data to CCP Overlay"**

This block allows you to send data to your agent from a CTI flow. The agent will see this information in the CCP Overlay in a panel entitled "Data."

- **Feature: CTI Flow Block: "Leave a Voicemail"**

This block works with the beta Voicemail Drops feature. When you configure the voicemailDropName and quickConnectName, it will pass the contact to an IVR to leave a voicemail on the agent's behalf.

- **Feature: CTI Flow Block: "Get Salesforce Lead ID":** This block allows you to get a Salesforce lead by using a phone number.

- **Enhancement:** "Get Salesforce Contact Id" block now uses FIND syntax to search across multiple fields.

- **BugFix:** For the `SetAgentStatusOnSessionEnd` feature, it would occasionally fail if the agent hadn't interacted with the webpage. We solve this by creating a popout to monitor the agent session.

- **Enhancement:** For the `SetAgentStatusOnSessionEnd` attribute, you can now specify multiple values.

- **Enhancement:** When `SetAgentStatusOnSessionEnd` feature is enabled, you can now configure which state the agent should be shown as when they login with the InitialAgentState setting.

- **Enhancement:** When `SetAgentStatusOnSessionEnd` feature is enabled, you can now configure which agent to logout when all tabs are closed by setting the Status to Logout.

- **Bugfix:** Addressed issue that caused CTI Flows to be run on every open Salesforce tab.

- **Bugfix:** Addressed an issue in "Get Salesforce Contact Id" block that caused the query to fail if the phone number was in E164 format.
