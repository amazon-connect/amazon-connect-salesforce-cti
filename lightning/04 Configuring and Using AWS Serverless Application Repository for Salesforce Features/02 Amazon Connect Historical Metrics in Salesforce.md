<h2 class="toc">Amazon Connect Historical Metrics in Salesforce</h2>

Amazon Connect can generate a number of historical metric reports to
monitor efficiency and utilization, agent performance, and other
information about your contact center. Amazon Connect provides you the
ability to schedule execution and export of reports, in comma separated
value (CSV) format, to the S3 bucket of your choice. This enables broad
compatibility across many analytics and WFM tools.

With the AWS Serverless Repository for Salesforce, you can configure the
automatic import of reporting data from Amazon Connect into Salesforce.
Two different historical reports are available to transport Agent and
Queue interval data from Amazon Connect to Salesforce. Once these have
been configured and scheduled, you will begin to see data available in
the reports that have been included with the CTI Adapter.

<h3 class="toc">Configuring the AWS Services</h3>

When you configure schedule reports to run in Amazon Connect, they are
saved to your reporting Amazon S3 bucket upon execution. As a part of
the schedule configuration, you can determine the frequency with which
data is exported. The standard configuration is for execution every 30
minutes; however you can increase the interval time to suit your
requirements.

Once you have the reports configured and scheduled, you will then need
to activate the trigger for the reports bucket that will invoke an AWS
Lambda function included in the AWS Serverless Repository for
Salesforce. This function will process the report and import the data to
Salesforce.

Once you have created the two reports and set their schedule, the next
thing you will need to do is to configure a trigger that executes a
Lambda function when the report is generated and stored in S3.

<h3 class="toc">Verifying the Data Import in Salesforce</h3>

Once you have configured the reports and added the triggers, you should
start to see data in Salesforce after \~30 minutes. The Amazon Connect
CTI Adapter comes with a predefined set of reports. These reports can be
customized and additional reports can be created by leveraging the
imported data.

<h4 class="toc">Viewing Amazon Connect Reports in Salesforce</h4>

1.  Log in into your Salesforce org and go to the **Service Console**

2.  Expand the **navigation menu** by selecting the down arrow and
    choose **Reports**

3.  In the left Navigation, select **All Folders**

4.  Select the **Amazon Connect Reports** folder

<img src="../media/image191.png" />

5.  In the list of reports, choose Average Handle Time queue report
