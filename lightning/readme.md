# Introduction

The Amazon Connect CTI integration consists of two components, a
[managed Salesforce package](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000EJH4yUAH)
and an [AWS Serverless application](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/)
deployed to your AWS environment. The managed package provides the core CTI
integration between Amazon Connect and Salesforce. The Serverless
repository adds to the core CTI integration by providing additional
tools that provide access and analysis of data from both platforms. With
these components, customers can build a deep integration between Amazon
Connect and Salesforce.
