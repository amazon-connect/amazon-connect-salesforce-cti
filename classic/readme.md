# Introduction

The core functionality of the Amazon Connect CTI Adapter provides a
WebRTC browser-based Contact Control Panel (CCP) within Salesforce. The
Amazon Connect CTI integration consists of two components, a [managed
Salesforce
package](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000EJH4yUAH)
and an [AWS Serverless
application](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/) deployed
to your AWS environment.

With those components, customers can build a deep integration between
the Amazon Connect contact center platform and Salesforce, the leading
customer relationship management (CRM) platform. The AWS Serverless
application package contains a set of common AWS Lambda functions to be
used by Amazon Connect to interact with Salesforce.

# Release Notes

Important: when upgrading the CTI Adapter, please make sure that the Salesforce Lambdas are also updated to the newest version.

## 5.9 December 2020

- **Feature**: Amazon Connect Contact Lens post call integration - Contact Lens transcripts and insights are now supported in CTI contact channel analytics
- **Feature**: Amazon Connect Tasks support - Added the Amazon Connect Task Contact as a source to CTI Flow in addition to Task specific events
- **Feature**: CTI Block - Is Task Contact? - Check if the contact is a task

- **Feature**: CTI Block - Pop Task Contact's Reference Urls - Pop any reference urls that are related to the task contact
- Upgraded Salesforce API to v50.0.
- **Feature update**: If you have CCP open on multiple tabs, CTI Flows will be executed only on one of them. The execution will be performed on the current tab, by default. If the agent is currently looking at a different site, a random tab will be selected to perform the execution.
- **Enhancement**: \$User.ProfileId is now available through "userProfile" property.
- **Enhancement**: CTI Flow execution timeout window has been increased to 60 seconds.
- **Feature update**: When the CCP popout is opened, we now ask for a confirmation before refreshing or closing the tab that opened it. Note that if you do close the original tab, the pop out might also be closed.
- **Bugfix**: Voicemail Drops feature has been fixed.
- **Bugfix**: CTI Flow "Open Subtab" block has been fixed.

## 5.7 November 2020

- **Feature**: Localization into 9 languages.

If this feature is enabled, the agent will be automatically shown as available when they login to Salesforce and the CCP.
- **Feature**: CTI Flow Block - Lengthâ
